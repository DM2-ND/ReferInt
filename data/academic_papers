1	line large scale information network embedding	j tang, m qu, m wang, m zhang, j yan	2015	dl.acm.org	This paper studies the problem of embedding very large information networks into low-dimensional vector spaces, which is useful in many tasks such as visualization, node classification, and link prediction. Most existing graph embedding methods do not scale for real world information networks which usually contain millions of nodes. In this paper, we propose a novel network embedding method called the``LINE,''which is suitable for arbitrary types of information networks: undirected, directed, and/or weighted. The method optimizes	https://arxiv.org/pdf/1503.03578
2	clustering and community detection in directed networks a survey	fd malliaros, m vazirgiannis	2013	Elsevier	Networks (or graphs) appear as dominant structures in diverse domains, including sociology, biology, neuroscience and computer science. In most of the aforementioned cases graphs are directed—in the sense that there is directionality on the edges, making the semantics of the edges nonsymmetric as the source node transmits some property to the target one but not vice versa. An interesting feature that real networks present is the clustering or community structure property, under which the graph topology is organized into	https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0370157313002822
3	a global geometric framework for nonlinear dimensionality reduction	jb tenenbaum, v de silva, jc langford	2000	science.sciencemag.org	Scientists working with large volumes of high-dimensional data, such as global climate patterns, stellar spectra, or human gene distributions, regularly confront the problem of dimensionality reduction: finding meaningful low-dimensional structures hidden in their high-dimensional observations. The human brain confronts the same problem in everyday perception, extracting from its high-dimensional sensory inputs—30,000 auditory nerve fibers or 10 6 optic nerve fibers—a manageably small number of perceptually relevant	https://science.sciencemag.org/content/sci/290/5500/2319.full.pdf
4	nonlinear dimensionality reduction by locally linear embedding	st roweis, lk saul	2000	science.sciencemag.org	Many areas of science depend on exploratory data analysis and visualization. The need to analyze large amounts of multivariate data raises the fundamental problem of dimensionality reduction: how to discover compact representations of high-dimensional data. Here, we introduce locally linear embedding (LLE), an unsupervised learning algorithm that computes low-dimensional, neighborhood-preserving embeddings of high-dimensional inputs. Unlike clustering methods for local dimensionality reduction, LLE maps its inputs into a single	https://science.sciencemag.org/content/sci/290/5500/2323.full.pdf
5	laplacian eigenmaps and spectral techniques for embedding and clustering	m belkin, p niyogi	2002	papers.nips.cc	Drawing on the correspondence between the graph Laplacian, the Laplace-Beltrami operator on a manifold, and the connections to the heat equation, we propose a geometrically motivated algorithm for constructing a representation for data sampled from a low dimensional manifold embedded in a higher dimensional space. The algorithm provides a computationally efficient approach to nonlinear dimensionality reduction that has locality preserving properties and a natural connection to clustering. Several applications are	http://papers.nips.cc/paper/1961-laplacian-eigenmaps-and-spectral-techniques-for-embedding-and-clustering.pdf
6	deepwalk online learning of social representations	b perozzi, r alrouf	2014	dl.acm.org	We present DeepWalk, a novel approach for learning latent representations of vertices in a network. These latent representations encode social relations in a continuous vector space, which is easily exploited by statistical models. DeepWalk generalizes recent advancements in language modeling and unsupervised feature learning (or deep learning) from sequences of words to graphs. DeepWalk uses local information obtained from truncated random walks to learn latent representations by treating walks as the equivalent of sentences. We	https://arxiv.org/pdf/1403.6652
7	network representation learning with rich text information	c yang, z liu, d zhao, m sun, e chang	2015	aaai.org	Abstract Representation learning has shown its effectiveness in many tasks such as image classification and text mining. Network representation learning aims at learning distributed vector representation for each vertex in a network, which is also increasingly recognized as an important aspect for network analysis. Most network representation learning methods investigate network structures for learning. In reality, network vertices contain rich information (such as text), which cannot be well applied with algorithmic frameworks of	https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/IJCAI/IJCAI15/paper/download/11098/10957
8	collective classification via discriminative matrix factorization on sparsely labeled networks	d zhang, j yin, x zhu, c zhang	2016	dl.acm.org	We address the problem of classifying sparsely labeled networks, where labeled nodes in the network are extremely scarce. Existing algorithms, such as collective classification, have been shown to be effective for jointly deriving labels of related nodes, by exploiting class label dependencies among neighboring nodes. However, when the underlying network is sparsely labeled, most nodes have too few or even no connections to labeled nodes. This makes it very difficult to leverage supervised knowledge from labeled nodes to accurately	http://scholar.google.com/scholar?output=instlink&nossl=1&q=info:3Embo88Zl60J:scholar.google.com/&hl=en&oe=ASCII&as_sdt=0,15&scillfp=10043662545797536333&oi=lle
9	deep neural networks for learning graph representations	s cao, w lu, q xu	2016	aaai.org	In this paper, we propose a novel model for learning graph representations, which generates a low-dimensional vector representation for each vertex by capturing the graph structural information. Different from other previous research efforts, we adopt a random surfing model to capture graph structural information directly, instead of using the sampling-based method for generating linear sequences proposed by Perozzi et al.(2014). The advantages of our approach will be illustrated from both theorical and empirical	https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI16/paper/viewPDFInterstitial/12423/11715
10	combining content and link for classification using matrix factorization	s zhu, k yu, y chi, y gong	2007	dl.acm.org	The world wide web contains rich textual contents that areinterconnected via complex hyperlinks. This huge database violates the assumption held by most of conventional statistical methods that each web page is considered as an independent and identical sample. It is thus difficult to apply traditional mining or learning methods for solving web mining problems, eg, web page classification, by exploiting both the content and the link structure. The research in this direction has recently received considerable attention but are	http://www.dbs.ifi.lmu.de/~yu_k/sigir2007_mf.pdf
11	node classification in social networks	s bhagat, g cormode, s muthukrishnan	2011	Springer	When dealing with large graphs, such as those that arise in the context of online social networks, a subset of nodes may be labeled. These labels can indicate demographic values, interest, beliefs or other characteristics of the nodes (users). A core problem is to use this information to extend the labeling so that all nodes are assigned a label (or labels). In this chapter, we survey classification techniques that have been proposed for this problem. We consider two broad categories: methods based on iterative application of traditional	https://arxiv.org/pdf/1101.3291
12	link prediction in complex networks a survey	l lu, t zhou	2011	Elsevier	Link prediction in complex networks has attracted increasing attention from both physical and computer science communities. The algorithms can be used to extract missing information, identify spurious interactions, evaluate network evolving mechanisms, and so on. This article summaries recent progress about link prediction algorithms, emphasizing on the contributions from physical perspectives and approaches, such as the random-walk-based methods and the maximum likelihood methods. We also introduce three typical	https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S037843711000991X
13	temporal link prediction by integrating content and structure information	s gao, l denoyer, p gallinari	2011	dl.acm.org	In this paper we address the problem of temporal link prediction, ie, predicting the apparition of new links, in time-evolving networks. This problem appears in applications such as recommender systems, social network analysis or citation analysis. Link prediction in time-evolving networks is usually based on the topological structure of the network only. We propose here a model which exploits multiple information sources in the network in order to predict link occurrence probabilities as a function of time. The model integrates three types	http://scholar.google.com/scholar?output=instlink&nossl=1&q=info:K9ptvAQzJgwJ:scholar.google.com/&hl=en&oe=ASCII&as_sdt=0,15&scillfp=8718487576707296805&oi=lle
14	regions periods activities uncovering urban dynamics via cross modal representation learning	c zhang, k zhang, q yuan, h peng, y zheng	2017	dl.acm.org	With the ever-increasing urbanization process, systematically modeling people's activities in the urban space is being recognized as a crucial socioeconomic task. This task was nearly impossible years ago due to the lack of reliable data sources, yet the emergence of geo-tagged social media (GTSM) data sheds new light on it. Recently, there have been fruitful studies on discovering geographical topics from GTSM data. However, their high computational costs and strong distributional assumptions about the latent topics hinder	https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/fd50/fa6954e1f6f78ca66f43346e7e86b196b137.pdf
15	learning graph based poi embedding for location based recommendation	m xie, h yin, h wang, f xu, w chen	2016	dl.acm.org	With the rapid prevalence of smart mobile devices and the dramatic proliferation of location-based social networks (LBSNs), location-based recommendation has become an important means to help people discover attractive and interesting points of interest (POIs). However, the extreme sparsity of user-POI matrix and cold-start issue create severe challenges, causing CF-based methods to degrade significantly in their recommendation performance. Moreover, location-based recommendation requires spatiotemporal context awareness and	http://net.pku.edu.cn/daim/hongzhi.yin/papers/CIKM-2016.pdf
16	distance aware dag embedding for proximity search on heterogeneous graphs	z liu, vw zheng, z zhao, f zhu, kcc chang	2018	aaai.org	Proximity search on heterogeneous graphs aims to measure the proximity between two nodes on a graph wrt some semantic relation for ranking. Pioneer work often tries to measure such proximity by paths connecting the two nodes. However, paths as linear sequences have limited expressiveness for the complex network connections. In this paper, we explore a more expressive DAG (directed acyclic graph) data structure for modeling the connections between two nodes. Particularly, we are interested in learning a representation	https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI18/paper/download/16770/15987
17	visualizing large scale and high dimensional data	j tang, j liu, m zhang, q mei	2016	dl.acm.org	We study the problem of visualizing large-scale and high-dimensional data in a low-dimensional (typically 2D or 3D) space. Much success has been reported recently by techniques that first compute a similarity structure of the data points and then project them into a low-dimensional space with the structure preserved. These two steps suffer from considerable computational costs, preventing the state-of-the-art methods such as the t-SNE from scaling to large-scale and high-dimensional data (eg, millions of data points and	https://arxiv.org/pdf/1602.00370
18	learning entity and relation embeddings for knowledge graph completion	y lin, z liu, m sun, y liu, x zhu	2015	aaai.org	Abstract Knowledge graph completion aims to perform link prediction between entities. In this paper, we consider the approach of knowledge graph embeddings. Recently, models such as TransE and TransH build entity and relation embeddings by regarding a relation as translation from head entity to tail entity. We note that these models simply put both entities and relations within the same semantic space. In fact, an entity may have multiple aspects and various relations may focus on different aspects of entities, which makes a common	https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI15/paper/viewFile/9571/9523
19	structural deep network embedding	d wang, p cui, w zhu	2016	dl.acm.org	Network embedding is an important method to learn low-dimensional representations of vertexes in networks, aiming to capture and preserve the network structure. Almost all the existing network embedding methods adopt shallow models. However, since the underlying network structure is complex, shallow models cannot capture the highly non-linear network structure, resulting in sub-optimal network representations. Therefore, how to find a method that is able to effectively capture the highly non-linear network structure and preserve the	http://pengcui.thumedialab.com/papers/SDNE.pdf

To enable knowledge discovery from such networked data, network representation learning (NRL) aims to learn vector representations for network nodes, such that off-the-shelf machine learning algorithms can be directly applied.

Representation learning is a set of techniques that has the goal of efficiently mapping data structures into convenient latent spaces.

Analyzing them yields insight into the structure of society, language, and different patterns of communication. Many approaches have been proposed to perform the analysis.

The primary challenge in this domain is finding a way to represent, or encode, graph structure so that it can be easily exploited by machine learning models. Traditionally, machine learning approaches relied on user-defined heuristics to extract features encoding structural information about a graph (eg, degree statistics or kernel functions).

Effective graph analytics provides users a deeper understanding of what is behind the data, and thus can benefit a lot of useful applications such as node classification, node recommendation, link prediction, etc. However, most graph analytics methods suffer the high computation and space cost.

This model learns low dimensional vectors to represent vertices appearing in a graph and, unlike existing work, integrates global structural information of the graph into the learning process. We also formally analyze the connections between our work and several previous research efforts, including the DeepWalk model of Perozzi et al. as well as the skip-gram model with negative sampling of Mikolov et al.

27	community structure in social and biological networks	m girvan, mej newman	2002	National Acad Sciences	A number of recent studies have focused on the statistical properties of networked systems such as social networks and the Worldwide Web. Researchers have concentrated particularly on a few properties that seem to be common to many networks: the small-world property, power-law degree distributions, and network transitivity. In this article, we highlight another property that is found in many networks, the property of community structure, in which network nodes are joined together in tightly knit groups, between which there are only	https://www.pnas.org/content/99/12/7821.full.pdf+html

Recently, linked data that contains both attribute and link information has become ubiquitous in various domains. For example, social media data is inherently linked via social relations and web data is networked via hyperlinks.

These learned representations have been demonstrated to be helpful in many learning tasks such as network clustering and link prediction. While existing algorithms follow an unsupervised manner, nodes in many real-world attributed networks are often associated with abundant label information, which is	http://faculty.cs.tamu.edu/xiahu/papers/wsdm17huang.pdf

One basic requirement of network embedding is to preserve the structure and inherent properties of the networks. While previous network embedding methods primarily preserve the microscopic structure, such as the first-and second-order proximities of nodes, the mesoscopic community structure, which is one of the most prominent feature of networks, is largely ignored.

Existing network embedding works primarily focus on preserving the microscopic structure, such as the first-and second-order proximity of vertexes, while the macroscopic scale-free property is largely ignored. Scale-free property depicts the fact that vertex degrees follow a heavy-tailed distribution (ie, only a few vertexes have high degrees) and is a critical property of real-world	https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI18/paper/viewPDFInterstitial/16558/15698
32	harp hierarchical representation learning for networks	h chen, b perozzi, y hu, s skiena	2018	aaai.org	We present HARP, a novel method for learning low dimensional embeddings of a graph's nodes which preserves higher-order structural features. Our proposed method achieves this by compressing the input graph prior to embedding it, effectively avoiding troublesome embedding configurations (ie local minima) which can pose problems to non-convex optimization. HARP works by finding a smaller graph which approximates the global structure of its input.

To address the interdependency among data instances, relational learning has been proposed, and collective inference based on network connectivity is adopted for prediction. However, connections in social media are often multi-dimensional. An actor can connect to another actor for different reasons, eg, alumni, colleagues, living in the same city, sharing similar interests, etc. Collective inference	https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Huan_Liu6/publication/221653118_Relational_learning_via_latent_social_dimensions/links/02bfe51412bcbb2a3a000000/Relational-learning-via-latent-social-dimensions.pdf
34	inductive matrix completion for predicting gene disease associations	n natarajan, is dhillon	2014	academic.oup.com	Motivation: Most existing methods for predicting causal disease genes rely on specific type of evidence, and are therefore limited in terms of applicability. More often than not, the type of evidence available for diseases varies—for example, we may know linked genes, keywords associated with the disease obtained by mining text, or co-occurrence of disease symptoms in patients. Similarly, the type of evidence available for genes varies—for example, specific microarray probes convey information only for certain sets of genes.

The quality of these representations is measured in a word similarity task, and the results are compared to the previously best performing techniques based on different types of neural networks. We observe large improvements in accuracy at much lower computational cost, ie it takes less than a day to learn high quality word vectors from a 1.6 billion words data set. Furthermore, we show that these vectors	https://arxiv.org/pdf/1301.3781.pdf%5D

In this paper we present several improvements that make the Skip-gram model more expressive and enable it to learn higher quality vectors more rapidly. We show that by subsampling frequent words we obtain significant speedup, and also learn higher quality representations as measured by our tasks.

Except the networks that include only vertices and edges, a variety of networks contain information about groups or communities. For example, on Facebook, in addition to users and the follower-followee relations between them, users can also create and join groups.

Gradient descent can be used for fine-tuning the weights in such “autoencoder” networks, but this works well only if the initial weights are close to a good solution.

Existing graph representation learning methods can be classified into two categories: generative models that learn the underlying connectivity distribution in the graph, and discriminative models that predict the probability of edge existence between a pair of vertices. In this paper, we propose GraphGAN, an innovative graph representation learning framework unifying above two classes of methods, in which the generative model	https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI18/paper/viewPDFInterstitial/16611/15969

The training procedure for G is to maximize the probability of D making a mistake. This framework corresponds to a minimax two-player game.

The values of the latent variables in the deepest layer are easy to infer and give a much better representation of each document than Latent Semantic Analysis. When the deepest layer is forced to use a small number of binary variables (eg 32), the graphical model performs “semantic hashing”: Documents are mapped to memory addresses in such a way that semantically similar documents are located at nearby	https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0888613X08001813/pdf?md5=8fe2f3860bf58ac305fd5e76e6088b74&pid=1-s2.0-S0888613X08001813-main.pdf&_valck=1

The resulting algorithm is a straightforward variation on the stacking of ordinary autoencoders.

The existing graph embedding methods cannot preserve the asymmetric transitivity well, which is a critical property of directed graphs. Asymmetric transitivity depicts the correlation among directed edges, that is, if there is a directed path from u to v, then there is likely a directed edge from u to v.

This is intrinsically difficult because of the curse of dimensionality: a word sequence on which the model will be tested is likely to be different from all the word sequences seen during training. Traditional but very successful approaches based on n-grams obtain generalization by concatenating very short overlapping sequences seen in the training set.

It has been used widely in many applications involving high-dimensional data, such as face recognition and image retrieval. An intrinsic limitation of classical LDA is the so-called singularity problem, that is, it fails when all scatter matrices are singular.

The model can include known predictor information in the form of a regression term, and can represent additional structure via sender-specific and receiver-specific latent factors. This approach allows for the graphical description of a social network via the latent factors of the nodes, and provides a framework for the prediction of missing links in network data.	http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.486.8643&rep=rep1&type=pdf

As a result, the visualizations are subject to the fundamental limitations of metric spaces. These limitations prevent multidimensional scaling from faithfully representing non-metric similarity data such as word associations or event co-occurrences. In particular, multidimensional scaling cannot faithfully represent intransitive pairwise similarities in a visualization, and it cannot faithfully visualize “central” objects.

Social systems can be seen as a nonlinear superposition of a multitude of complex social networks, where nodes represent individuals and links capture a variety of different social relations. Much emphasis has been put on the network topology of social interactions, however, the multidimensional nature of these interactions has largely been ignored, mostly because of lack of data.

Thus, an observed social network provides a noisy signal about the latent underlying “social space''---the way in which individuals are similar or dissimilar.

Existing approaches usually assume the completeness of linkage and content information. However, the links and node attributes can usually be partially observable in many real-world networks. For example, users can specify their privacy settings to prevent non-friends from viewing their posts or connections.

585	learning structural node embeddings via diffusion wavelets	c donnat, m zitnik, d hallac, j leskovec	 2018	dl.acm.org	Nodes residing in different parts of a graph can have similar structural roles within their local network topology. The identification of such roles provides key insight into the organization of networks and can be used for a variety of machine learning tasks. However, learning structural representations of nodes is a challenging problem, and it has typically involved manually specifying and tailoring topological features for each node. In this paper, we develop GraphWave, a method that represents each node's network neighborhood via a low-dimensional embedding by leveraging heat wavelet diffusion patterns. Instead of training on hand-selected features, GraphWave learns these embeddings in an unsupervised way. We mathematically prove that nodes with similar network neighborhoods will have similar GraphWave embeddings even though these nodes may reside in very different parts of the network, and our method scales linearly with the number of edges. Experiments in a variety of different settings demonstrate GraphWave's real-world potential for capturing structural roles in networks, and our approach outperforms existing state-of-the-art baselines in every experiment, by as much as 137%.	 https://arxiv.org/pdf/1710.10321.pdf

587	network representation learning a survey	d zhang, j yin, x zhu, c zhang 	 2018	ieeexplore.ieee.org	With the widespread use of information technologies, information networks are becoming increasingly popular to capture complex relationships across various disciplines. In reality, the large scale of information networks often makes network analytic tasks computationally expensive or intractable. Network representation learning has been recently proposed as a new learning paradigm to embed network vertices into a low-dimensional vector space, by preserving network topology structure, vertex content, and other side information. This facilitates the original network to be easily handled in the new vector space for further analysis. In this survey, we perform a comprehensive review of the current literature on network representation learning in the data mining and machine learning field. We propose new taxonomies to categorize and summarize the state-of-the-art network representation learning techniques according to the underlying learning mechanisms, the network information intended to preserve, as well as the algorithmic designs and methodologies. We summarize evaluation protocols used for validating network representation learning including published benchmark datasets, evaluation methods, and open source projects. We also perform empirical studies to compare the performance of representative algorithms on common datasets, and analyze their computational complexity. Finally, we suggest promising research directions to facilitate future study.	https://arxiv.org/pdf/1801.05852.pdf
